Here is my interview experience at various companies in October 2021.

# Facebook
## Phone screen
I got asked two questions. Neither was too hard but I had to solve them quickly.
Here is one: https://leetcode.com/problems/diagonal-traverse/
The other one is similar to this, except it is to add two floating point numbers: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/
I finished diagonal-traverse and got most of the way through add-strings before time ran out. Had maybe 15 minutes on add-strings.
No real hints

## Second phone screen
See CityFinder.java in this package for the question and my solution.

# DoorDash
## Phone screen
I got asked this Leetcode hard question https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/ with no hints in
less than 45 minutes.
Actually the hint she gave me, to "just start coding" was I felt more unproductive. It probably would've been better to
walk through my thought process with an example first. She also gave me a hint after I'd written code for 30 minutes and didn't have time do finish the rest.
I could've prepared more for this one. I didn't pass.

# Microsoft
## Phone screen
I got asked https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/ except for floating point numbers, same as the Facebook phone screen!
A major difference was that the interviewer gave me a hint, to "add zeroes onto the end of the numbers like transform 23.4 + 2.53 into 23.40 + 02.53"
This is a major hint, and made it much easier, since the major difficulty I had with the Facebook screen is keeping track of the index.
I solved it with time left and had some time to conceptually go over a follow up, which was "what if the numbers have negative values?"

# Affirm
## Phone screen
I got a coding question. Not too hard.

# Wayfair
## Phone screen
I went through Karat, which was easy.

# Indeed
## Phone screen
I already passed Karat so was fast-forwarded past Indeed's Karat.
