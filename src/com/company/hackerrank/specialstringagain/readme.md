# My experience
## March 10 2021
I got this one wrong because I didn't read the requirements clearly enough, and solved for "find the palindromes" 
rather than "find the special strings". I also got it wrong because I didn't consider all the corner cases... I 
guess the latter would have been improved if I'd worked through some sample input. I'm torn between spending time on 
understanding requirements, working through sample input, etc. for problems like this vs. just moving on because the 
problem isn't teaching me too much new. Not sure the best way to practice. Maybe best way is just make sure you have 
the basics.
