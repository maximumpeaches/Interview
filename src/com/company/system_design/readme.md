Each of the sub-folders in this folder are meant to answer one design question.
For example the folder named "chat" contains notes and answers to the question, "How would you design a chat system?"
Within these folders there are files. My current schema is that files named "notes.md" are meant for raw, unpolished notes,
and my files named "summary.md" are more polished and attempt to answer key points in how to design the system.
