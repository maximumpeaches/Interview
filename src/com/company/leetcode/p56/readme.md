# My experience
## March 26, 2021
Solved this one on first go. It becomes a bit more interesting because it requires sorting... and you can get a more 
complex radix sort if you want, which makes the problem more difficult. If you want practice with radix sort then 
this would be good to review, but I feel radix sort is overly challenging to implement in a typical interview.

It helped a lot to come up with examples as I went through the problem. There was an edge case (where the interval 
completely overlaps the subsequent interval) which I totally would have missed had I not come up with examples 
before implementing the solution. I think it's really good to come up with test cases before writing out the code 
and working substantially on the algorithm. It also is just a natural way to make sure you understand the problem.
