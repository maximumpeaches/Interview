Pretty easy to come up with a solution which passes all their test cases. Their solutions are a little different, but I don't think they're faster. Not sure if this one is worth reviewing later.

Some bugs in my implementation, like I had some null pointer exceptions because I didn't initialize a Map and I 
didn't realize a Set could be null, and I also used the reserved words "short" and "long" as variable names. Things 
an IDE definitely would've caught. Overall though I solved it in a speedy amount of time, and not enough difficulty 
to justify practicing again any time soon. I solved it quickly because I've seen a lot of problems like this before..
. just a typical dynamic programming problem.
