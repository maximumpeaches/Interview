I would suggest viewing the hints.md file *after* you've solved for the provided test case and *before* submitting.
One of the test cases causes a TLE, and you'll just see what I mean if you look at the hints.md file.

Also you can try and solve this one in different ways... you can see the Solution section in Leetcode if you want. 
Although solving it in different ways is not necessary, just if you feel like it and have time.

Solved this one in decent time, but I also attempted it a few days ago and so that's why I was able to solve it 
quickly this time. So, I should try this one again soon to review. There are also a lot of similar problems to this 
one so it's good to get an idea of how to solve this type of problem.
