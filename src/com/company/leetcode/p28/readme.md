# My experience

There are a couple ways to solve this. You have a card in Anki going over the ways to solve it using different 
string matching algorithms. Basically the naive is pretty easy and you can come up with, the rabin-karp is do-able 
and probably worth practicing, and the knuth-morris-pratt is hard enough to implement that I'm not sure it's worth 
the time to learn it as it would be kinda ridiculous to try to implement during an interview, but hey if you have 
time give it a shot! I do think this problem is good to review if only to know the different algorithms and their 
different runtimes for string matching, and your Anki card can help with that, even if you don't implement the 
knuth-morris-pratt one b/c it's hard to implement (but if you have time maybe you can, just not making it a priority 
right now).
