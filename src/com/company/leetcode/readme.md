# Should review
Below is a list of problems from Leetcode or topics which I'd like to review. Most of them have an associated date, 
which means I should come back to them not before, and ideally at, that date (I leave a date in the future so I am 
taking advantage of [distributed learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_practice)).

- [Segment tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/segment-tree/) actually has a number of problems related to it.
- need to figure out how to construct union-find data structure. To do so see: https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/
- after/on Aug 31 do other LCA of binary tree problems. One every other day or so. After you've done them a couple 
ways, review the Solution tab here: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ You can 
also use that link to find the similar problems.
- 287 around Sept 1st. Try reviewing conceptually first.
- 581 on/after Sept 1 (see readme.md file)
- Practice 323 sometime after Sept 3rd or so.
- p1143 practice after Sept 4th.
- p41 practice after Sept 7th
- p99 really good one. on/after Sept 9th
- p29 really good one. on/after Sept 9th. See readme.md first.
- 856 on/after Sept 10th
- 1526 on/after Sept 10th
- 23 on/after Sept 11th. Try conceptually going over it, and coming up with time and space complexities of different 
solutions, first.
- 142 on/after Sept 11th (just the O(1) space solution)
- 77 after Sept 12
- p1041 review after September 16th or so
- p46 review after Sept 19th
- 215 on/after September 19. See readme.md
- 857 on/after Sept 19th just review conceptually for now. Can you remember both solutions, the okay one and the 
optimized one?
- 92 on/after Sept 20th.
- 280 on/after Sept 20th
- 96 on/after Sept 20th
- p1072 on/after Sept 20th, review (at least conceptually, implement if have time but not sure it is the most popular 
question to ask)
- 126 on/after Sept 20
- 694 on/after Sept 20th need to review conceptually first
- 399 on/after Sept 21
- 239 on/after Sept 21. Shoot for O(n) time complexity
- p122 - review after/on Sept 21
- 735 on/after Sept 25 great problem to practice
- 252 on/after Sept 23 - try it to practice Java API
- 489 on/after Sept 23
- 729 on/after October 1st - good to practice implementation
- 123 on/after Oct 5th. then try 188. (this whole series is interesting to review)
- review 272 on/after Oct 15th
- 523 Oct 20
- 72 November 22nd
- 981 November 20th
- 198 on/after Nov 24
- 124 between December 1st and March 1st
- Review how to generate the hashCode (you can see how IntelliJ implements it using the Objects.hash method if a class 
has for instance a String and an integer as fields). I didn't remember this when I went to go use it.

Notes:
p45 is really good practice in coming up with the corner cases *first* before running through the algorithm. 
Conceptually I got it, but it's easy to miss corner cases or miss errors that can come up when implementing it.
Also a more natural way to write code in an interview is to write a little and then walk through it, rather than 
walking through the whole thing at the end. This also seems easier for the interviewer.
Review Collections.cop
- Remember to come up with space and time complexity when you do a problem, and then verify they are correct when you 
look at the answer.
