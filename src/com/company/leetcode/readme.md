# Should review
p122 - try as soon as can
p99 - refer to README first though. Will likely need to read other people's solutions before sinking much more time 
into it.
p1072
p31
p1675
p973 helps to practice without autocomplete in IntelliJ for practice with Java syntax. Actually easier approach is 
just creating an Anki card with the PriorityQueue API on it.
p254
p1041 attempted last time on August 16th. Maybe review in a month on September 16th.
p91 review the readme again, as it has a good lesson.
p1249 Good to review for practice coming up with good test cases and working through them, which is a really 
important  skill for real interviews!
