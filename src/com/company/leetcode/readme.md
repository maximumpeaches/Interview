# Should review


p31
p1675
p973 helps to practice without autocomplete in IntelliJ for practice with Java syntax. Actually easier approach is
just creating an Anki card with the PriorityQueue API on it.
p1249 Good to review for practice coming up with good test cases and working through them, which is a really
important  skill for real interviews!
## String matching
p1071, p1392

Jump Game 3, 4 would be fun to practice.
Word Distance 2, 3
try Subsets 1 & 2, Combination Sum 1 & 2, Permutations 1 & 2, maybe one a day, as per [this answer](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/discuss/18239/A-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-Java-(Subsets-Permutations-Combination-Sum-Palindrome-Partioning))

[Segment tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/segment-tree/) actually has a number of problems related to it.
- need to figure out how to construct union-find data structure. To do so see: https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/

206 on/after Aug 27
280 August 28th
272 on/after Aug 28
2 after/on August 29 (low priority)
try 50 after Aug 30 but don't look at sample inputs and try to come up with them on your own.
after/on Aug 31 do other LCA of binary tree problems. One every other day or so. After you've done them a couple 
ways, review the Solution tab here: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ You can 
also use that link to find the similar problems.
287 around Sept 1st. Try reviewing conceptually first.
581 on/after Sept 1 (see readme.md file)
Practice 323 sometime after Sept 3rd or so.
p1143 practice after Sept 4th.
p41 practice after Sept 7th
p99 really good one. on/after Sept 9th
p29 really good one. on/after Sept 9th. See readme.md first.
1526 on/after Sept 10th
142 on/after Sept 11th (just the O(1) space solution)
77 after Sept 12
p1041 review after September 16th or so
p46 review after Sept 19th
p1072 on/after Sept 20th, review (at least conceptually, implement if have time but not sure it is the most popular 
question to ask)
126 on/after Sept 20
694 on/after Sept 20th need to review conceptually first
399 on/after Sept 21
239 on/after Sept 21. Shoot for O(n) time complexity
p122 - review after/on Sept 21
735 on/after Sept 25 great problem to practice
252 on/after Sept 23 - try it to practice Java API 
123 on/after Oct 5th. then try 188. (this whole series is interesting to review)
523 Oct 20
72 November 22nd
981 November 20th
198 on/after Nov 24

Review how to generate the hashCode (you can see how IntelliJ implements it using the Objects.hash method if a class 
has for instance a String and an integer as fields). I didn't remember this when I went to go use it.

Need to practice heap sort with the PriorityQueue API, and also what to do if want to invert the order of the heap 
so it returns the last element when you call peek() or remove().

Notes:
p45 is really good practice in coming up with the corner cases *first* before running through the algorithm. 
Conceptually I got it, but it's easy to miss corner cases or miss errors that can come up when implementing it.
Also a more natural way to write code in an interview is to write a little and then walk through it, rather than 
walking through the whole thing at the end. This also seems easier for the interviewer.
Review Collections.cop
- Remember to come up with space and time complexity when you do a problem, and then verify they are correct when you 
look at the answer.
