Overall easy but I missed a test case.
This one is good to review just to practice coming up with good test cases and making sure your solution works for them.
As I become more familiar with these problems, I think it's fundamentals like checking all the test cases that I need to be more concerned with,
rather than learning fancy algorithms.
