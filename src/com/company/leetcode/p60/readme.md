This problem is pretty insane. I would never ask someone this in an interview because it's next to impossible to 
solve if you haven't seen it before.

That being said, if you're done with all the rest of the easy / medium problems, the solution provided by Leetcode 
is pretty informative. Right now there are lower hanging fruit for me to work on.
