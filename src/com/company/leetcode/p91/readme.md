This problem is pretty straightforward dynamic programming.
Note it has poor ratings on Leetcode.
I imagine the reason is that you have to check the input for validity (for instance you could receive "600") which 
doesn't add much to the problem, but just requires some book keeping.
Although I guess it is good to have this sort of problem to reinforce the idea that you could have invalid input. 
It's something you have to clarify with the reviewer.
It's good to review this problem.
