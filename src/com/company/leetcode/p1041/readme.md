# My experience
# August 16th, 2021
Solved pretty straightforwardly. I think it helped to write it out on a notebook.
There was also a better solution in the Solution section of leetcode that I didn't do, but I would never expect an 
interviewee to solve it other than the way I did.

I solved with some difficulty, and missed a test case but then was able to recover.
This is a good one to review as it's kind of unique / interesting.
Probably review in a month or so, not before that would be too easy to remember the solution.
