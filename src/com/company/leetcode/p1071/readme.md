Could try implementing.

Spent 1 hour on this. Didn't solve it because question is phrased in a tricky way, so I solved a different question.
Notice example #2 which says the solution should return "AB" when str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB".
I feel like this problem is phrased in a tricky way because it doesn't call that out very clearly.
