I was asked this in a practice interview on interviewing.io
The interviewer said I solved it, and he was impressed.
There is another way to do it but it sounds more complicated.
He also rephrased the question so I can't exactly paste my answer into Leetcode to get it to work, but probably 
don't need to at this point anyways.
I don't think there's a huge need to review this one or practice again soon, but it took some struggling so wouldn't 
hurt to review it.
