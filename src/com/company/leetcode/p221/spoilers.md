My confidence in my solution went up a lot when I realized this problem is basically the same as the problem "find 
the largest substring in both strings" except it is in a matrix instead of a string. It's a typical string matching 
kind of problem, though, and accordingly has a similar solution of dynamic programming. This realization gave me 
confidence that this is one of the best solutions for this problem.
