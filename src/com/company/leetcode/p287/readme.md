This one is interesting. I don't know how generalizable it is, so I wouldn't put it at the top of your priority list, since an interview really has to be checking if you know one trick on this one, but it's interesting when you get to it.
Here's a good problem to solve before this one: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

This one has an O(n) solution that is very tricky, and a O(nlogn) solution that's also pretty neat.

The solution article is great for this one.
