The O(n^2) nieve solution you may be thinking about times out. You have to solve in O(n).
I didn't come up with the right solution. I think, unless you remember how to do it, you should just check the 
Discussion tab to see how they solved it. This one I've never seen anything like before.
It's interesting because I've never seen anything like it, but I wouldn't expect an interviewee to solve it.
