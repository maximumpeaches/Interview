The lesson of this problem is - you must come up with and test your test cases!

Algorithmically this problem is not too hard, but that it's asked so much shows that the interviewer is largely 
concerned with you coming up with all the test cases and solving for them. Write down test cases as you come up with 
them so that you remember to test them at the end, as whiteboard won't have built in test cases like Leetcode does!

This is a good problem to practice again some time when it's not so easy to remember. But when you do practice again 
you should really work out all the test cases and work them by hand. If you're not willing to do that it's not 
really worth the time to practice. There's no significant algorithmic trick here.
