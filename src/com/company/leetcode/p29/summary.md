Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.

You can only use numbers that fit within the maximum and minimum of Java int values (so no using the long value). Be 
aware of what those values are (you may have to Google them). If your answer would overflow, then return the maximum 
positive value.
