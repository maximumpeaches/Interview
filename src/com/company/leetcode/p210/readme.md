This problem requires topological sort, which is used in some other problems too.
There are two ways to solve this problem, both discussed in the Solutions tab.
I solved it halfway in probably the harder way. It was taking a long time so I stopped.
Probably quicker to solve it with the other way of doing it.
I think this can be good practice, but kinda a niche / hard problem so not to invest too much time.
Actually probably just worth the time of figuring out the easy way to do it, conceptually, at least for now unless 
have more time later.
