p45 is really good practice in coming up with the corner cases *first* before running through the algorithm.
Conceptually I got it, but it's easy to miss corner cases or miss errors that can come up when implementing it.
Also a more natural way to write code in an interview is to write a little and then walk through it, rather than
walking through the whole thing at the end. This also seems easier for the interviewer.
