Practiced this one. I tried it a couple days ago, too. I was able to do well on it this time. My advice would be to 
draw out an example and really work through it, both before you write the code and after you write the code to test. 
There are some other similar problems which also make good practice.

I think it's good to practice this or similar questions every once in a while since it's one area that I'm not super 
familiar with and can be a little tricky to master, and it's a specific skill doing this kind of problem.
