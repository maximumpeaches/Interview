# My experience
## August 18th 2021
I looked again at this problem and agree with the summary of March 28th below that I probably don't need to
practice it further. I get the idea and how to implement it, and it's a lot of work to implement. I do agree
with March 28th note about the value of learning ASCII conversion though.

It is interesting to think of this problem as a DFS problem, though, besides just a DP problem.

One thing to note is one weak point is I don't know very well how ASCII and converting from char to int works. Like, 
if I just do 32 + s.charAt(i) does that automatically convert s.charAt(i) to ASCII? It's just something easy to 
learn that would help.

I don't think need to redo this problem, already did plenty of work on it.
I can't finish right now b/c need to upload the whole project to GitHub, but prob don't need to finish later either.
My solution(s) seem to be similar to the one given on the website as well.
