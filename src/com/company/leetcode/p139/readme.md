# My experience
## March 28th 2021
One thing to note is one weak point is I don't know very well how ASCII and converting from char to int works. Like, 
if I just do 32 + s.charAt(i) does that automatically convert s.charAt(i) to ASCII? It's just something easy to 
learn that would help.

I don't think need to redo this problem, already did plenty of work on it.
I can't finish right now b/c need to upload the whole project to GitHub, but prob don't need to finish later either.
My solution(s) seem to be similar to the one given on the website as well.
