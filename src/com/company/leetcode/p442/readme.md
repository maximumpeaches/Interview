Solved quickly because have seen similar problems lately.
Good to review this one because it's well-worded and there are a couple problems similar to it so it has useful 
techniques.
You can also think of some algorithms that use non-constant space and don't run in O(n) time. Worth just thinking of 
them next time you practice.
