I think this one is good to practice in a month or two to get more familiar with the Java syntax. Also there's a 
tricky bug at one point that might be good to review, maybe.

I solved this fine (see Solution2.java) but took some Googling so good to practice again. The mnemonic "if you're
trying to find the minimums, use a maxHeap, if you're trying to find the maximums, use a minHeap" is helpful.
I had to Google Comparable, Comparator, and Generics.
