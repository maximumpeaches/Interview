Solved pretty quickly, but had some false starts which wasn't ideal for this problem as it's not too hard.
My plan is to work on similar problems (versions 2, 3, 4) of this problem for additional practice, and then won't 
need to practice this particular problem again I think. I will also look at the Solution tab after I practice with 
the other ones.
