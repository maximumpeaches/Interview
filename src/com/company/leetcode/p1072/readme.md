Pretty interesting one to at least review conceptually every once in a while.

I reviewed this one conceptually, and looked at the Discuss tab for the solution. Not a bad idea to implement it 
(although there are a ton of problems to work on, not sure how popular this one is).

There is a much easier solution to this if you look on the Discuss tab of Leetcode.
I didn't realize the easier solution the first time I tried this problem.
This problem is good to review to go over the easier solution.

Solved in 2 hours after some troubleshooting. Felt like I made progress.
I think is a good one to practice again.
