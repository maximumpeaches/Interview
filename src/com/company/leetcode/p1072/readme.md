# My experience
## Aug 12 2021
There is a much easier solution to this if you look on the Discuss tab of Leetcode.
I didn't realize the easier solution the first time I tried this problem.
This problem is good to review to go over the easier solution.

Solved in 2 hours after some troubleshooting. Felt like I made progress.
I think is a good one to practice again.
