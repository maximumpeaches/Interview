The website www.levels.fyi has a service where they match you with a recruiter and that recruiter helps you out
by telling you what to say to recruiters when you are negotiating with them. It was 100% worth the money, and ended up
helping me to increase my salary by over $10k. I also just felt much more confident in negotiations and it saved me
a lot of mental anguish over what to say, or regretting what I'd said. The notes below were transcribed from audio so
they are hard to understand, sorry.

I took some notes:
Yeah so I did the levels that FYI recruiter call with this guy named Jason and it was great I want to take some notes. 
So he said a lot. 

One thing he talked about was how recruiters really are judged based on the number of candidates 
that say yes and not the number that the company pays them. So that makes me feel a little better pressuring the
recruiter because they don't really give a shit I just want you to sign. 

He also told me how the recruiter basically has some leeway where they can increase your salary by 5%, 10% or 15%. 
And then after that they reach around the 50% the median level of the current band for that area and need to get approval
from the compensation team before offering more.

He says that the comp team has a normal distribution of all the salaries for an area and after 
you get past the 50% like the middle of the band then the comp team is going to say "we think we have a 
pretty good idea of what offers for this market like" and then at that point you have to really show 
them data like your competing offers. So at first you know I can just say to him like hey based on my market 
research I really want to get around 230 I'll probably says to indeed. But actually he said suggested that first of all 
I should really wait for the recruiter to give me a number. Just say to the recruiter in no I'm still interviewing 
these places and I really am excited about indeed and I would just like it if you know I have based on my market 
research I'm aiming for around 230 if we can get there love great. So then sorry it's so but first of oh you know 
really just say you know I'm interviewing elsewhere if we could just I really am excited about indeed I could stop 
interviewing elsewhere you know if we could just get an offer from a DW great and then after you get the initial offer 
from indeed then you start saying like hey you know I'm thinking about going to my market research I'm really closer to 
around 230 you know I have some friends who are making that much money. Ask hey if you could get me closer to that 
range of it away some of my concerns. He said really not to like tell them that you're looking for a certain or not to 
say it like so at the very end he kind of phrase it in stages writes the first day just get the offer from no second 
stage is do you like oh well I'm really looking for like you know 1520 minutes give them he suggested giving them a 
range so like 30 I can say like 230 to 250 kind of thing well I'm still kind of waiting for these other offers to come 
in. So then once I get the 230 so then and then after that stage you know then indeed comes back they're going to have 
something a little closer to what I am but it's not gonna be exactly what I'm asking for but it's gonna be closer. And 
then eventually just keep asking for more you know and he really just suggest asking for more I mean it was a great talk 
I wish I could've recorded it. he had a lot of good advice. And then the last stage is really saying like hey I'm 
willing to commit to this if you can get me here.

Another thing about the level start FYI former recruiter with negotiation tips is there are two things one is I really 
do kind of after like 2 to 4 weeks they can note from from the initial offer they really do you can I have to be like 
hey we can they will either send the offer or yeah they used to stick and say the carrot and so yeah you have to like 
give them some time fine but it's closer to like 2 to 4 weeks where is soon as they make it feel like it's right away 
sometimes. He also you know they always say like this is my final best offer and it may or may not be true you know you 
can just ask for like a little more than just a little more just a little but yeah.
