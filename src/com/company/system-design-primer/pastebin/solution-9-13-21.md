Trying this on September 13th 2021.

Step 1:
Ask clarifying questions.
My understanding of this problem is that user enters a URL and then gets back a shorter URL. That there is a one to 
one mapping of the long to short URL. If the URL the user enters is not a valid URL then I can say there is some error.
One question is how many URLs will be entered at once during peak use hours?
Another question is do we need to link these URLs to an account?
What kind of end to endlatency do we want to achieve? (maybe there is a standard latency for web services that is 
good to stay under) We might shoot for example under 100ms ideally.
Do we need to re-use URLs, so there is a one-to-one mapping? Or is it okay if we have a one-to-many mapping?
I could ask what kind of uptime we need to maintain. High SLA is stated in problem, so maybe good to ask.
Do we need to save monthly visit stats long term?

Each paste might consist of
1 short url 5KB
