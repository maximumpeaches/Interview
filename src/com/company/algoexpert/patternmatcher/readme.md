# My experience
## March 9th 2021
I solved it in less than 30 minutes on first try. Not sure exact time.
I have lost faith in AlgoExpert from this experience. Fixing my output to match the specific format they wanted was 
frustrating, when they could have just accepted any order of Strings in the result, they required a very specific 
order, and the order they requested was not well-worded in the problem description.
I also didn't learn much from this problem. I mean it's always good to practice, but I didn't learn a new algorithm 
or anything. It's just a string matching with some added complexity of this unique case. I not only don't want to 
practice this problem again, but am skeptical of the rest of the AlgoExpert problems, because I haven't found any so 
far that teach me something new.
It was okay though. Maybe there will be something useful / unique eventually. Just low bar for these problems so far.
The author didn't try very hard.
