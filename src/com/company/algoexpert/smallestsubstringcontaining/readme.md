# My experience
## March 9th 2021
I solved this on first try in less than 30 minutes.
I need to be careful to read the problem description in the future. Working through some example input / output to 
make sure I clarify the problem will help make sure I don't miss something in the description.
I think this problem is not worth practicing again because it's mostly just record-keeping and nothing new.
But it was good to realize I should make sure I understand the problem statement! And always good to practice more.
I am not sure AlgoExpert is a great platform to practice with, although their "Famous Algorithms" section sounds 
interesting, and why not use them. I guess my expectations were higher.
