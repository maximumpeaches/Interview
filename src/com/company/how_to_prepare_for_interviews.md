I'm not an expert on preparing for interviews, and this list doesn't encapsulate everything I know. So it may not help you much.
That said, below are my tips on preparing for system design and algorithmic sections of tech interviews.

How to find good companies and apply:
* With four years of experience and Amazon on my resume, applying immediately post-COVID when the job market is super hot,
  I got a ton of interviews simply by applying on company's websites. I also got referrals where I could and some recruiters
  (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Salesforce) reached out to me through LinkedIn. I found other good companies to work
  for by looking at the top-paying companies on www.levels.fyi. The tech companies in the top 100 companies list by Glassdoor
  also had some good options, although most of those I already knew about. In the end I had more companies to interview with
  than I really needed, so I didn't have to find other ways to find interviews. I ignored mostly the random recruiters on LinkedIn,
  especially when they didn't work directly for a company but worked for a recruiting agency.
* I have a good video on how to write your resume for tech that I can share with you if you message me.
* I looked up the work life balance ratings of companies on teamblind.com and the pay of companies on www.levels.fyi to
  figure out if I wanted to interview with them.
* It always helps to have multiple offers to negotiate a good deal. You can also just ask for more money and a lot of time they'll give
  you an additional 7-12% just because you asked. Always ask for more by saying "I'll accept the offer if I can get X". 
  Some companies (like Google) can't budge on offers without a higher offer from another company as rationale.

How to prepare for algorithms:
* One thing I think helps a lot is to review problems conceptually rather than implement everything. You can read a
  problem, then try to say out loud the algorithm, then check your answer. I did this with problems in Elements of Programming
  Interviews and Cracking the Coding Interview, and am now doing it with Leetcode. I implement problems I think I need practice
  with, but a lot of problems are easy to implement once you know the idea so I don't implement them and it saves time I can spend
  working on problems I otherwise wouldn't get to.
* Generally you should prepare for algorithmic questions by doing lots of questions on Leetcode or EPI or CTCI. Then when
  you schedule interviews with a company (or as soon as you know you will interview with some company) you should do the
  problems on Leetcode for that specific company, and not just do random problems from Leetcode any more until after your interview.
* I like to walk while reviewing problems conceptually (or implementing them if I have a walking desk). I just like walking in general, and it makes me happy.
* I took notes on which problems I did, and used lists feature on Leetcode to mark problems I want to practice or problems
  I already mastered. I also took notes on system design books or websites I read.
* It's really important to begin algorithmic questions by asking clarifying questions and then coming up with examples to clarify.
  This is something you don't necessarily get practice with using Leetcode, and I found interviewing.io useful for. I liked
  both the peer mock interviews and the paid mock interviews on interviewing.io (although they are pricey). [This Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
  is good practice for clarifying different potential inputs before you begin.
* You also need to practice walking through a problem and debugging it by hand, as in most interviews you won't be able to compile and run code. 
  Although in a few interviews so far they've asked me to compile and run the code. To debug by hand, work through an 
  example, and write down the variables and update their state as you go along.
* To be honest on Leetcode I don't clarify every problem before I begin, or debug by hand, because it would take too long.
  It seems to be okay, but I just have practiced that way a few times and would do so in a real interview.

How to prepare for system design:
* System design is actually pretty easy to prep for, even though people often make it sound challenging to prepare for.
  System Design Interview by Alex Yu and Web Scalability for Startup Engineers are the two books I'd recommend for beginners.
  After those books, Designing-data Intensive Applications (DDIA) and Designing Microservices are great. DDIA also has a good audiobook version on Audible.
  The new version of the Grokking the System Design course is pretty good too, although I think a lot of their 
  "How would you design X?" questions have worse answers than the answer for that question in System Design Interview. 
  System Design Interview is well-researched on what real-world systems look like and cites references. You can download
  books at gen.lib.rus.ec [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) is another resource
  although I would recommend the other resources before it, and it contains a lot of overlapping info with the other resources.
* I suggest watching this video for system design to get an idea what you should know: [Prepare for Your Google Interview: Systems Design](https://youtu.be/Gg318hR5JY0)
* For system design you can also research how the real company has designed their system. Take notes when you research.
  I think it would be cool to have a group of friends who all research system designs in the real world and then present
  (informally) what they find to each other. However researching how companies are built is slower than reading the resources
  I mentioned previously, so I would do it after reading those books and Grokking.
